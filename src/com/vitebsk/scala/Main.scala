  /*  Write a recursive function that counts how many different ways you can make change for an amount, given a list of coin denominations. For example, there are 3 ways to give change for 4 if you have coins with denomiation 1 and 2: 1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 2+2.*/

/*    Do this exercise by implementing the countChange function in Main.scala. This function takes an amount to change, and a list of unique denominations for the coins. Its signature is as follows:

    def countChange(money: Int, coins: List[Int]): Int
    Once again, you can make use of functions isEmpty, head and tail on the list of integers coins.*/

/*      Hint: Think of the degenerate cases. How many ways can you give change for 0 CHF? How many ways can you give change for >0 CHF, if you have no coins?*/

  //  def countChange(money: Int, coins: List[Int]): Int
